## Q&A

### What does this add / do?

- This builds on top of AiT features by adding; exteriors, interiors, consoles, sonics, and more..

### Why does it only work on AiT 1.1.0 and above?
  
- AiT 1.1.0 is the latest public version (at the time) and has features that are requried for the certain things to work, these features weren't present in previous versions of the mod.

### Will this mod be ported to forge or neoforge?    
  
- No, even though ait had a forge version, this mod will be exclusivly for fabric. Why, ait's forge is no longer supported
